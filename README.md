# cygmaðŸ”¥ theme

## dark contrasting theme for true cygmasðŸ”¥

intended to be used for web-devs, optimized syntax highlighting for:
- HTML
- CSS (and preprocessors like SCSS, LESS, SASS)
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- JSON
- Markdown

i **do not care** how the syntax highlight works on any other languages. it should work, but the look might be eyebleeding. so if you are using python, rust, java or anything else, just know - **YOU ARE NOT CYGMA**

## installation
1. install extension
2. open *Settings* > *Color Theme* (`Ctrl + K Ctrl + T`)
3. select *Cygma*
4. enjoy your eyebleeding experience
